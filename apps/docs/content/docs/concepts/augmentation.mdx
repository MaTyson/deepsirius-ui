Just like the dataset, the augmentation node is a
[node](/docs/concepts/workspace#nodes) responsible for creating an augmented
version of an existing dataset. When clicked, the augmentation will open a panel
with a form to be filled in with the necessary information to create an
augmented dataset.

Unlike the dataset node, the augmentation node requires a dataset to be
connected to it before submitting a job, since the job needs an existing dataset
to perform the augmentation transformations. A dataset in a `success` state can
be connected to the augmentation node by clicking and dragging a connection line
from the dataset node bottom side
[handle](/docs/concepts/workspace#node-handles) to the augmentation node top
handle. Or you can create a connected augmentation node by clicking on the
handle in the bottom side of the dataset node.

Data augmentation strategies are able to generate artificial data by applying
small deformations on the original data. The main purpose is to generate
slightly different data, increasing the number of labeled data when scarce, and
creating more challenging problems for the classifier, leading to a more
generalized network. The following parameters are directly related to shape and
are applied to the original image.

<Callout title="Watch out!" type="error">
  When saving the dataset, take into account that each increment of augmentation
  will increase the size of the dataset in proportion to the sample size. In a
  sample size of 100 if we add vertical and horizontal flip, It would be the
  same as considering a sample size of 300 (100 + 100 + 100).

## Vertical and Horizontal flip

Enabling it allows the network to understand that different patterns of rotation
exist.

## Rotations

Rotates the image in 90 and 270 degrees while also resizing the image.

## Contrast

If you need to segment images with different contrast patterns in relation to
the dataset, it is better to enable this option. It will make the network learn
not only one pattern of contrast, but a whole new range of possible contrast
situations.

## Gaussian Blur

The higher the Ïƒ value, the higher the smoothing. In this parameter, you
basically are destroying the texture in order to make a better classification of
shape.

## Elastic transformations

It determines if in your training it will accept variations in shape
(distortion) and texture.

- **Alpha**: stands for the deformation intensity.
- **Sigma**: stands for the quantity of random noise over deformation to change
  the pixel intensity value (randomness over deformation).

## Dropout

It determines the number the percentage of pixels randomly dropped.

## Poisson Noise

Add noise sampled from poisson distributions elementwise to images.

Poisson noise is comparable to Gaussian noise. Poisson distributions produce
only positive numbers, so the sign of the sampled values is randomly flipped.
For uint8, a lambda of around 10.0 leads to visible noise, and a lambda of
around 20.0 results in very visible noise. It is recommended to set per_channel
to True, as this augmenter samples and adds noise elementwise, affecting
neighboring pixels differently.
