description: Guide for some core concepts of the UI and the deep learning workflow.
---

This section dives into the main components and concepts of the UI and how they interact with
the `ssc-deepsirius` processing package and with each other. We intend to provide
a comprehensive guide for the components, their properties, and how to use them.
Also, we will focus on the technical details of the deep learning workflow
implemented in the processing package and how each component's form parameter
impacts the results and learning analysis.
