  Use of tensorboard for visualization of training and inference data.

import GalleryTensorboard from "@/public/assets/screenshots/page-workspace-gallery-tensorboard.png";

When a training job is running, you can monitor the training progress and
visualize the training data using
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard). TensorBoard is a
visualization tool that comes with TensorFlow and is used to visualize the
training process, metrics, and model architecture. It is particularly useful for
monitoring the training process, debugging, and optimizing the model.

The service runs on the same node as the training job and can be accessed
through the browser via a URL provided in the job logs. When the user clicks on
the "Open Tensorboard" button in the gallery page, the a new tab will open with
the tensorboard interface and the user can monitor the training process while
the job is running. When the job is running, the user can also see a clickable
link in the gallery, in case the user closes the tensorboard tab. After the job
is finished, the tensorboard will be disconnected.

## Using the Scalars Dashboard

### Navigate to Scalars

In the TensorBoard interface, you will see a sidebar on the left. Click on
"Scalars" to access the Scalars dashboard.

<Callout type="info" className="">
  The loss will be shown each 20 iterations steps once the network starts
  training. The history of the training will be saved and in subsequent
  fine-tuning process the tensorboard will initialize with previous loss. This
  means if you want to access history you can just open a fine-tune of 1
  iteration to open a tensorboard (that won't train, see finetune section).
</Callout>

### Viewing Scalars

The Scalars dashboard displays graphs of scalar values that are logged during
training. Those values for DeepSirius are loss and validation loss.

### Customizing Display

- **Tags:** Tags correspond to the different scalar values logged (e.g., loss,
  accuracy). You can select or deselect tags to customize the displayed graphs.
- **Smoothing:** Use the smoothing slider above the graphs to adjust the level
  of smoothing applied to the scalar graphs. This helps to reduce noise and
  better visualize trends.

### Refreshing Data

- **Automatic Refresh:** You can adjust the refresh rate by clicking on the
  settings icon (gear icon) in the top right corner and setting the "Reload data
  every" option. However, once the job is finished the refresh will show its
  disconnected.
- **Manual Refresh:** If you need to manually refresh the data, click the
  refresh button located near the top right of the Scalars dashboard. This is
  useful if automatic refresh is too slow or if you suspect new data has been
  logged but not yet displayed.

### Detailed View

- **Hover for Details:** Hover over any point on the graph to see the exact
  value at that step.
- **Zoom:** Click and drag on the graph to zoom into a specific range.
  Double-click to reset the zoom.

### Exporting Data

- **Download CSV:** You can export the scalar data by clicking on "show dowload
  options" at the top left, and pressing the download button at the bottom right
  of the graph for SVG file or downlonad the CSV/JSON at the bottom right.

## Using the Images Dashboard

Each class will otuput a probability map, once the tensorboard and the job is
running, you can see the output of each patch in the image section. Above each
image will contain information if its a ground truth image, an inference image
or the original image and the step of inference. To acess other available steps,
slide the bar right above each image.

_Tensorboard Image Visualization: Only training inference is selected. For the 13,000th
step, the images are displayed in the following order: the original label (ground
truth), the original image, and the output probability map of the class._
