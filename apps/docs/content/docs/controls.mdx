## Home page

The home page is the first page you see when you access the DeepSirius web
application. It is a simple landing page where you can log in and see a link to
this documentation. After the login, the home page shows the link to the
[user page](#user-page) and the [avatar menu](#avatar-menu) with more navigation
and session controls.

<ImageZoom
  alt="Home Page Logged"
  src={PageHomeLogged}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Example of a home page with the login button, the link to the user workspaces page
and the avatar menu on the top right side of the screen._

## Login page

The login page is where the user is redirected when clicking the login button on
the home page. It is a simple form where the user can input their email and
password to log in with their CNPEM credentials.

<ImageZoom alt="Login Page" src={PageLogin} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
_Example of a login page with the form to input the email and password._

## Avatar Menu

The avatar menu is a dropdown menu that appears on the top right corner of the
screen if the user is logged in. It contains links to the user page, the home
page, a switch for dark/light mode, and a logout button.

## User page

The user page is where the user can control their workspaces. It contains a list
of their previously created workspaces, with the option to favorite `heart` or
delete `trash` them. There is also above this list a search bar, where the user
can search for already existing workspaces by name and a `+ New` button, which
redirects the user to the [new workspace page](#new-workspace-page) to create a
new workspace.

<ImageZoom
  alt="User Page with avatar"
  src={PageUserEmptyWithAvatar}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Example of a user page with an empty list of workspaces, a search bar, the `+ New`
button and an opened [avatar menu](#avatar-menu)._

<ImageZoom
  alt="User Page with favorite workspaces"
  src={PageUserWorkspacesFavorite}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Example of a user page with a list of workspaces and a favorited workspace on the
top of the list._

## New Workspace page

The new workspace page is where the user finds a form for submitting a job to
[create a new workspace](/docs/concepts/workspace#creating-a-new-workspace).

<ImageZoom
  alt="New Workspace"
  src={PageNewWorkspace}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Example of a new workspace page with the form to create a new workspace._

On this page, after sumitting the form, the controls are disabled and the job id
is shown over the submit button. If the job is successful, there will be
notifications on the bottom right corner of the screen and the user will be
redirected to the [workspace page](#workspace-page).

If the job fails, there will be a notification about the error and the controls
will be enabled again.

## Workspace page

The [workspace](/docs/concepts/workspace) page contains the canvas where the
user can create and connect [nodes](/docs/concepts/workspace#nodes).

<ImageZoom
  alt="New Workspace Empty"
  src={PageWorkpaceBoardEmpty}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Example of a workspace page. The canvas is empty and the name of the workspace is
shown on the bottom of the screen._

Its main components are:

- The canvas, where the user can create, connect, move and delete nodes and
  occupies the majority of the screen.
- The new node button, which opens a dropdown menu to create a new node and is
  located on the top left corner of the screen.
- The fit to screen button and help button, which are located on the bottom left
  corner of the screen.
- The mini map, which is located on the bottom right corner of the screen and
  shows a small version of the canvas with a rectangle representing the current
  view.
- The [avatar menu](#avatar-menu), which is located on the top right corner of
  the screen.
- The [nodes](/docs/concepts/workspace#nodes) and its connections which are free
  to be moved and connected on the whole canvas.
- The [node side panel](/docs/concepts/workspace#node-side-panel), which is only
  shown when a node is selected and is located on the right side of the screen
  and shows the properties of the selected node.

## Gallery Page

The [gallery page](/docs/concepts/workspace#gallery-page) can only be accessed
by clicking on the link on the side panel of a node and it displays more
detailed information about the job and remote files and processes depending on
the node type and the options available to that node.

<ImageZoom
  alt="Gallery View"
  src={PageWorkspaceGalleryImages}
  className="!my-0 rounded-sm"
/>
_Gallery view of an augmentation node showing the preview images option. As some
of the options are intervals with max and min values, two images are generated for
these cases and identified as `Option_name_max` and `Option_name_min`. Since the
augmentation node does not perform training, the option for the tensorboard view
is not available for this node._
