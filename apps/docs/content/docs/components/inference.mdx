## 1 - Normalize images

If the images are not normalized, this option should be enabled. Normalizing images is a common practice because it improves optimization during training. By default, the network receives normalized images during training. Therefore, inference in non normalized images will produce bad results.

## 2 - Probability map

The output is a probability map, where each channel "n" corresponds to the probability of that voxel corresponding to the label "n".
If the probability map is not select will infer a label image where each voxel corresponds to the label with probability higher or equal to 0.5.

## 3 - Padding size

Adds a 0-valued frame around the input image to ensure that boundary effects to classification being done patchwise are mitigated.

## 4 - Patch size

Similar to Volume Padding, this parameter controls the amount of overlap between patches sampled over the target image for inference. Lower values increase classification speed at the cost of edge artifacts. In other words, it determines how much edge will be thrown away when making the inference. We throw it away because of an edge effect on each patch inside the image.
