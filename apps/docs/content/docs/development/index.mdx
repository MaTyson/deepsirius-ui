The DeepSirius project is divided in two main parts: the UI and the processing 
package, which are described below.

1. **DeepSirius UI**: The UI is built using Next.js, a React framework.
It interacts with an HPC cluster and storage system through SSH, SLURM and APIs. 
It runs jobs by calling containers with Singularity through bash scripts that run 
Python packages for the predefined processing steps.

2. **ssc-deepsirius processing package**: The processing package is a Python 
package that contains a CLI to interact with the UI for every processing job
run by the UI. It is the main processing engine of the DeepSirius project and
all the deeplearning models are run using this package.

The following sections will guide you through the development process for both
the UI and the processing package. We will focus briefly on the main concepts
and tools used in the project, and provide you with the necessary information
to start contributing to the project.
