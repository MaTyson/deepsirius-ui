This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new workspace and a 
basic deep learning workflow using the DeepSirius UI app. By the end, you should
be able to create a dataset, augment it, train a network, fine-tune it and run an
inference. Start with nothing, and end with a fresh set of labels.

Have fun!

  ## Sign in
  Please make sure you have access to the CNPEM internal network or the VPN. 
  Also that you have the necessary permissions to create jobs on the cluster. 
  You will need a CNPEM account to access the DeepSirius Web App and know the 
  SLURM queues you are allowed to use.

  With that settled you can log into the [DeepSirius](https://deepsirius.lnls.br)
  with your CNPEM email address and password.

  ## Create a new workspace
  Access your workspaces by clicking on the `Workspaces` button on the center of 
  the homepage. This will redirect you to your workspaces page, where you can see
  all the workspaces you have already created or create a new one.

  Click on the `New` button to create a new workspace. You'll be redirected to a 
  new page where you can fill a form with the path in the storage to where the 
  workspace will be created, the name of the workspace and a slurm partition to 
  run this creation job.

  On job completion, you will be redirected to the workspace workboard, where you 
  can create and connect the components of your workflow. Each component represents
  a job that will be run in the cluster and corresponds to a step in the deep
  learning workflow.

  The next steps will be done in the workspace you just created. If, for some
  reason, you are not there, please go back to the workspaces page and click on
  the workspace you just created to open it.
