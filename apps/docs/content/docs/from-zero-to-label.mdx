Here we will guide you through the process of creating a new workspace and a basic deep learning workflow using the DeepSirius UI app.

## Step 0: Making sure you have access and loging in

This steps means you can access the DeepSirius Web App i.e. the CNPEM network or the VPN is working properly. But also that you have the necessary permissions to create jobs on the cluster.
You will need a CNPEM account to access the DeepSirius Web App and know the SLURM queues you are allowed to use.

Knowing your credentials, you can log in to the DeepSirius Web App by going to the [DeepSirius Web App](https://deepsirius.lnls.br) and logging in with your CNPEM credentials.

## Step 1: Creating a new workspace

After logging in, you can acces your workspaces page by clicking on the "Workspaces" button on the top right corner of the page.
This will redirect you to the workspaces page, where you can see all the workspaces you have already created or create a new one.

### The workspace workboard

This is the main page of the DeepSirius Web App, and were you will spend most of your time. Here you can create individual nodes that represent the basic units of the deepsirius deep learning workflow, such as datasets, augmentations, networks, finetunings and inferences. Each of these units mean an independent job you cant configure and submit to the cluster.

In this page, you will be able to see the status of each node, based on the state of the jobs and its relations with each other an the workspace itself and the files it generates in the storage.

## Step 2: Creating a dataset

## Step 3: Augmenting a dataset

## Step 4: Training a network

## Step 5: Fine-tuning a network

## Step 6: Running an inference
