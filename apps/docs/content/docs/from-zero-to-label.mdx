This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new workspace and
a basic deep learning workflow using the DeepSirius UI app. By the end, you
should be able to create a dataset, augment it, train a network, fine-tune it
and run an inference. Start with nothing, and end with a fresh set of labels.

Have fun!

  ## Sign in
  Please make sure you have access to the CNPEM internal network or the VPN. 
  Also that you have the necessary permissions to create jobs on the cluster. 
  You will need a CNPEM account to access the DeepSirius Web App and know the 
  SLURM queues you are allowed to use.

With that settled you can log into the [DeepSirius](https://deepsirius.lnls.br)
with your CNPEM email address and password.

  ## Create a new workspace
  Access your workspaces by clicking on the `Workspaces` button on the center of 
  the homepage. This will redirect you to your workspaces page, where you can see
  all the workspaces you have already created or create a new one.

Click on the `New` button to create a new workspace. You'll be redirected to a
new page where you can fill a form with the path in the storage to where the
workspace will be created, the name of the workspace and a slurm partition to
run this creation job.

On job completion, you will be redirected to the workspace workboard, where you
can create and connect the components of your workflow. Each component
represents a job that will be run in the cluster and corresponds to a step in
the deep learning workflow.

## Create a new dataset

<Callout title="Get in the workspace!" type="warn">
  The next steps will be done in the workspace you just created. If, for some
  reason, you are not there, please go back to the workspaces page and click on
  the workspace you just created to open it.
</Callout>

On the workspace page, click on the button with the `+` sign to create on the
top left corner of the page to open a menu containing the names of the nodes you
can create. Click on the `Dataset` button to create a new dataset.

This will create a new dataset node in the the middle of the workboard. Click on
the node to open the dataset creation form on a panel that will appear on the
right side of the page. Fill the form with the name of the new dataset, and
click on the `Add Data` button to start selecting a group of image, label and
(optinally) weight map files to construct your dataset. You can click on the
`+ More!` button to add as many more groups of files to the dataset as you need.
Any row of this part of the form needs at least one image and one label file to
be valid. By clicking on each button of this row, a remote file navigator opens
to help you search and select the path on the storage server where the files are
located. The deepsirius app only works with files that are located in the
storage server, so make sure to upload your files to the storage server before
creating the dataset.

## Make the dataset bigger

After creating the dataset, you can augment it by clicking on the bottom
`handle` of the dataset node or by clicking on the `+` button on the top right
corner of the workspace workboard and selecting the `Augmentation` node. This
will create a new augmentation node in the workboard. Click on the new node to
open the side panel with the augmentation form. Fill the form with the name of
the new augmented dataset, and select the augmentation techniques you want to
apply to the dataset.

After the job is completed, you can click on the `Details` link at the bottom of
the side panel to go to the
[gallery page](/docs/concepts/workspace#gallery-view) and see a list of preview
images demonstrating the selected augmentation operations with the selected
parameters applied to a slice of an image from the dataset. These images don't
represent the dataset, since its made of patches, but serve as a method to
verify if the chosen operations and parameters are producing the intended
outcome.

## Train a network

After augmenting the dataset, you can train a network by clicking on the right
`handle` of a dataset or augmentation node or by clicking on the `+` button on
the top right corner of the workspace workboard and selecting the `Network`
node. This will create a new network node in the workboard. Click on the new
node to open the side panel with the network form. Fill the form with the name
of the new network, and select the network architecture, and other parameters
related to the training process.

After the job is submitted, you can click on the `Details` link at the bottom of
the side panel to go the [gallery page](/docs/concepts/workspace#gallery-view)
and see the training evolution by clicking on the `Tensorboard` button. This
will trigger a tensorboard instance that will show the training evolution of the
selected network.

## Not enough? Fine-tune it!

After training a network, you can fine-tune it by clicking on the bottom
`handle` of a network node or by clicking on the `+` button on the top left
corner of the workspace workboard and selecting the `Fine-tune` node. This will
create a new fine-tune node in the workboard.

The fine-tune node needs to be connected to a network and a dataset node to
work. You can connect the fine-tune node to a dataset or a augmentation node by
dragging its left `handle` to the right `handle` of the dataset or augmentation
node. The same goes for the network node.

The fine-tune node has a form similar to the network node, but you can't select
the network architecture and have the option to
[drop the classifier](/docs/concepts/network#drop-classifier) of the network.

You can add as many finetune nodes as you want to a network node by connecting a
new fine-tune node to the bottom handle of a network node or a fine-tune
connected to a network node. This is simply to register the fine-tune jobs
separately, since the fine-tune job is a continuation of the training job and
only changes the files related to the same network on the storage server so you
can't delete a fine-tune, but you can delete the network node to delete all the
fine-tune nodes connected to it.

## Time to label

Finally, with a trained network, you can run an inference on new data by
clicking on the right `handle` of a network or by clicking on the `+` button on
the top left corner of the workspace workboard and selecting the `Inference`
node. This will create a new inference node in the workboard.

The inference node needs to be connected to a network and a new set of images to
make inference on. You need also set a remote path to where the inference
results will be saved.

After the job is completed, you need a volumetric image visualization tool to
properly see the results, like the Annotat3D or Index plataforms provided
internally by CNPEM or any other tool that can visualize volumetric labeled
images.
